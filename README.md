# HTML-Repo

In this file, I will put up every other html assignment code possible for later reference.

 # Objectives
1. Add almost every other html assignment file possible.
2. Make sure the Output is as expected, and 
3. Most important thing, NOT EVEN A SINGLE ERROR MUST BE THERE IN THE SOURCE CODE TO PUBLICIZE THE REPOSITORY.
